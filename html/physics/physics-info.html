                    The purpose of this class is not only to learn about physics, but to explore and be able explain the various of ideas that make up physics. We will accomplish this task by using the same mathematical techniques and technology used in the industry, developing skills necessary for successful data acquisition in a laboratory. of this class is to explain and explore the various ideas that make up physics. Just like in normal lab, there will be a lot of work done collaboratively. Working together is highly encouraged, however, cheating/plagiarism will not be tolerated. If you received help, give them credit. However, if you are suspected or found to be cheating, the cheating policy by the Dean of Students will be enforced.

                    As mentioned above, you will need a separate binder <strong>ONLY</strong> for this class. You should have dividers with the following headings:

                <p>
                    You should have a separate <mark class="highlight px-2 bg-blue-dark">"Completed Homework Folder"</mark> where you place your assignments ready to be turned in. You may use the front pocket of your binder for this, just make sure to label the pocket properly.

                    The lecture notes for this class are made and distributed by the instructor. During class, your task will be to follow along and fill out the outline. This way, all your notes are in one place and if youâ€™re absent, you know what notes to get. <strong>Guard these with your life.</strong>

                                    School today is very different from how it was in the past, allowing for easier communication between teachers, parents and students. Ensuring the success of students is an equal team effort. Therefore it is important that you also keep track of what your child is doing in class to help keep them focused.
                                    
                                    Some recommendations are:

                                    <li>Provide a time and space for your student to do work.</li>
                                    <li>Please do not wait until the end of the semester to see how your child is doing. Check in with your child at least every two weeks to see how they are doing in the class.</li>
                                    <li>You are welcome to contact me by email, phone or office hours. Please allow 24 hours for a response. If you have not heard from me in 24 hours, follow up emails are always appreciated.</li>

Do not think you may spend 15 minutes or even 15 seconds looking for where you have put it, finishing one question, stapling pages together or even writing your name on it. Work is due when you arrive in the room. The same concept applies to bringing the materials, calculators and tools that are necessary for you to do your job, the job of being a student. Remember that while you are in my course, my objective is to prepare you for the real world and the consequences you will face will be of the same level as those in the real world. If you come without your tools, you cannot work and hence will not be paid that day. You will not receive credit for the work assigned or collected that day
